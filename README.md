Stands for Top Down Stealth Puzzle

Made with LWJGL (another acronym (Light Weight Java Game Library))

Made as a project, and also the testing field for certain game elements.

For the textures I used:

- http://pyromancers.com/dungeon-painter-online/
- www.piskelapp.com

Along with hours of messing around, until I got bored and said that will do.
