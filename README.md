Stands for Top Down Stealth Puzzle<br />
Also called the 'Covert Exit'
(Although sadly it is currently missing the stealth part, working on that though)

Made with LWJGL (another acronym (Light Weight Java Game Library))

Made as a project, and also the testing field for certain game elements.

For the textures I used:

- http://pyromancers.com/dungeon-painter-online/
- www.piskelapp.com
- Along with other websites that can be found in the log.
- Along with hours of messing around, until I got bored and said that will do.

Since this is an early version, one which I will expand upon as I go on learning different and new things, some help would be nice to have.

I plan on taking this and expanding it to the size of a proper game with a story. Which means I am working on the various different mechanics to use.
