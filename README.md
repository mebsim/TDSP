# TDSP

Stands for Top Down Stealth Puzzle<br />
Also called the 'Covert Exit'

Made with LWJGL (another acronym (Light Weight Java Game Library))

Made as a project, and also the testing field for certain game elements.

For the textures I used:

- http://pyromancers.com/dungeon-painter-online/
- www.piskelapp.com
- Along with other websites that can be found in the log.
- Along with hours of messing around, until I got bored and said that will do.
